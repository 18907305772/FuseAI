Actions:

{actions}

Your action should contain multiple steps, and each step starts with #. After each action (except OUTPUT), state which action you will take next with ''Next action: [Your action]'' and finish this turn. Continue this process until you reach a satisfactory conclusion or solution to the problem at hand, at which point you should use the [OUTPUT] action. The thought process is completely invisible to user, so [OUTPUT] should be a complete response. You should strictly follow the format below:

[ACTION NAME]

# Your action step 1

# Your action step 2

# Your action step 3

Next action: [NEXT ACTION NAME]


Now, begin with the [ASSESS] action for the following task:

        <|end_of_thought|> \
        Each step should include detailed considerations such as analisying questions, summarizing \
        relevant findings, brainstorming new ideas, verifying the accuracy of the current steps, refining \
        any errors, and revisiting previous steps. \
        In the Solution section, based on various attempts, explorations, and reflections from the Thought \
        section, systematically present the final solution that you deem correct. The solution should \
        remain a logical, accurate, concise expression style and detail necessary step needed to reach the \
