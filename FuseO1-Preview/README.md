## Overview

FuseO1-Preview is our initial endeavor to enhance the System-II reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through innovative model fusion techniques. 
By employing advanced [SCE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07990) merging methodologies, we integrate multiple open-source o1-like LLMs into a unified model. 
Our goal is to incorporate the distinct knowledge and strengths from different reasoning LLMs into a single, unified model with strong System-II reasoning abilities, particularly in mathematics, coding, and science domains.

To achieve this, we conduct two types of model merging:

- Long-Long Reasoning Merging: This approach involves model fusion across LLMs that utilize long-CoT reasoning, with the goal of enhancing long-CoT reasoning capabilities.
- Long-Short Reasoning Merging: This approach involves model fusion between long-CoT and short-CoT LLMs, aiming to improve reasoning capabilities in both long and short reasoning processes.

## Long-Long Reasoning Merging

We conduct experiments on these folloing long-cot LLMs.

- [Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview)
- [NovaSky-AI/Sky-T1-32B-Preview](https://huggingface.co/NovaSky-AI/Sky-T1-32B-Preview)

The results [FuseAI/xxx]() is based on the folloing merging configurations.

```yaml
xxx
```

We provide the code to use [FuseAI/xxx]().

```python3
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

llm = LLM(model="FuseAI/xxx", tensor_parallel_size=8)
sampling_params = SamplingParams(max_tokens=32768, temperature=0.7, stop=["<ÔΩúend‚ñÅof‚ñÅsentenceÔΩú>", "<ÔΩúUserÔΩú>"], stop_token_ids=[151643, 151644])

conversations = [
    [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful and harmless assistant. You should think step-by-step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Quadratic polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ have leading coefficients $2$ and $-2,$ respectively. The graphs of both polynomials pass through the two points $(16,54)$ and $(20,53).$ Find $P(0) + Q(0).$."},
    ],
]

responses = llm.chat(messages=conversations, sampling_params=sampling_params, use_tqdm=True)

for response in responses:
    print(response.outputs[0].text.strip())
```

## Long-Short Reasoning Merging

We conduct experiments on these folloing long-cot and short-cot LLMs.

- [deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B)
- [Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct)

The results [FuseAI/xxx]() is based on the folloing merging configurations.

```yaml
xxx
```

We provide the code to use [FuseAI/xxx]().

```python3
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

llm = LLM(model="FuseAI/xxx", tensor_parallel_size=8)
sampling_params = SamplingParams(max_tokens=32768, temperature=0.7, stop=["<ÔΩúend‚ñÅof‚ñÅsentenceÔΩú>", "<ÔΩúUserÔΩú>"], stop_token_ids=[151643, 151644])

conversations = [
    [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful and harmless assistant. You should think step-by-step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Quadratic polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ have leading coefficients $2$ and $-2,$ respectively. The graphs of both polynomials pass through the two points $(16,54)$ and $(20,53).$ Find $P(0) + Q(0).$."},
    ],
]

responses = llm.chat(messages=conversations, sampling_params=sampling_params, use_tqdm=True)

for response in responses:
    print(response.outputs[0].text.strip())
```

## Evaluation Results

We test the resulted models on three kinds of benchmarks, including **Math Reasoning**, **Code Reasoning** , and **Scientific Reasoning**.

Math Reasoning
  - AIME24
  - MATH500
  - GSM8K

Scientific Reasoning
  - GPQA-Diamond
  - ARC-Challenge
  - MMLU-Pro
  - MMLU
  

Code Reasoning
  - LiveCodeBench

The [evaluation code](https://github.com/fanqiwan/FuseAI/tree/main/FuseO1-Preview/evaluation) is modified from [SkyThought](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyThought). In our evaluation, we set the temperature to 0.7 (sampling) and the max_tokens to 32768.

The evaluation results are shown in the table below:

## Future Work

This work is our first attempt effort to achieve knowledge fusion of System-II reasoning LLMs through a model merging approach. In future work, we plan to employ our [explicit model fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10491) method, based on multi-teacher knowledge distillation, and our [implici model fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03187) method, which utilizes weighted-reward preference optimization.
Furthermore, we intend to explore the combination of knowledge fusion with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which have been demonstrated as the most effective approach for enhancing reasoning abilities. Stay tuned for the next version of FuseO1!
